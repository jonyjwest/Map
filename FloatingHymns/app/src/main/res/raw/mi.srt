1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,215
It pays to serve Jesus,

2
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:07,053
I speak from my heart,


3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:10,884
He'll always be with us,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,900
if we do our part

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,700
There's naught in this wide world


6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:22,434
can pleasure afford;


7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,700
There's peace and contentment

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,700
in serving the Lord.
