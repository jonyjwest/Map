87000%IT PAYS TO SERVE JESUS
4000%It pays to serve Jesus,
3000%I speak from my heart,
3000%He'll always be with us,
4000%if we do our part
3000%There's naught in this wide world
3000%can pleasure afford;
3000%There's peace and contentment
4000%in serving the Lord.

4000%And oft when I'm tempted
3000%to turn from the track,
4000%I think of my Saviour,
3000%my mind wanders back
3000%To the place where they nailed Him
3000%on Calvary's tree.
3000%I heard a voice saying,
3000%"I suffered for thee."
