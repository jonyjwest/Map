1
00:00:87,220 --> 00:00:90,215
It pays to serve Jesus

2
00:00:90,148 --> 00:00:95,053
I speak from my heart

3
00:00:95,004 --> 00:00:99,884
He'll always be with us

4
00:00:99,300 --> 00:00:102,900
if we do our part

5
00:00:102,500 --> 00:00:105,700
There's naught in this wide world

6
00:00:105,434 --> 00:00:109,434
can pleasure afford;

7
00:00:109,600 --> 00:00:112,700
There's peace and contentment

8
00:00:112,600 --> 00:00:115,700
in serving the Lord.
